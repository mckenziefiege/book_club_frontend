# Novel Finds

Novel Finds is an app designed to keep track of what you're reading and to join book clubs in you're area. Users are able to search and add books to their "want to read", "read", and "currently reading" lists. For each book, users are able to favorite, change category, leave a review or delete. Users have the ability to create a book club, search book clubs using their zip code, and join a book club. Not only can users write reviews, but they can search for reviews by entering the title of a book. Lastly, users are able to create a new account and login in using their password. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
